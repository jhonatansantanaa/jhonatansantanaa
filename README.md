# About me

Mobile Software Developer focused on Kotlin and with experience in Flutter and modern technologies. Recently, I dedicated myself to developing applications using XML, RxJava, Firebase, MySQL, DAO, Retrofit and the MVVM architecture pattern. Additionally, I am studying Jetpack Compose and Kotlin Multiplatform to expand my skills and offer even more innovative solutions.

I'm currently studying Software Engineering and I'm in my first semester. I have focused a lot on my studies and specialization in Mobile Software, participating in practical projects and learning techniques with Experienced Mentors.

In pursuit of proficiency in software architecture concepts, always apply the principles of DDD, Clean Architecture and Event Driven Architecture to create robust and scalable applications. My goal is to combine cutting-edge technology with best development practices to provide advanced user experiences.

Always looking for new challenges, I am ready to contribute to ambitious and innovative projects.
