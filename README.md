--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm a 20-year-old, Software Engineering enthusiast and I'm currently in the first semester of the course. I have a great interest in mobile development, focusing on both native applications using Kotlin and hybrid solutions using Flutter, both with cross-platform capabilities.

I am passionate about technology and am always looking for new knowledge and challenges. I consider myself a great researcher, constantly exploring new programming languages, frameworks and emerging technologies. I believe that the key to success in the area of software development is constant learning and the ability to adapt to new environments and paradigms.

This repository on GitHub is a reflection of my interest in sharing knowledge and experiences with other developers. Here you will find projects, experiments and studies related to my academic and professional career.

Feel free to explore my projects and contact me if you have any questions, suggestions or just want to exchange ideas about software development.
